= Publishing legacy BXMS 6.x guides using Pantheon

Starting with enterprise version 6.4, the documentation is published exclusively through Pantheon.

== Prerequisites

* A Pantheon account with publishing permissions. For more information, see <<_pantheon_roles_and_permissions>>.
* A GitLab account with proper permissions.

== Procedure

. In the Enterprise GitLab repository, check out the 6.x preview branch for the product version you want to publish. With version 6.4, for example:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git checkout 6.4-preview
----
+
. Open the `$_$REPOSITORY_PATH_/docs/shared/document-attributes.adoc` file in a text editor and update the `:REBUILT:` variable. Save the file.
. Add and commit the changes with a descriptive commit message, for example:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git commit -m "Update rebuilt variables"
----
. Tag the commit with a tag that describes which version was published and the current date:
+
--
[source,bash]
----
$ git tag "$VERSION-rel-$DATE"
----

The `_$VERSION_` is the version of the product and the `_$DATE_` is the current date in the ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`). For example, the following tag is for version 7.0, which is released on Aug 22, 2018:

[source,bash]
----
$ git tag "6.4-rel-2018-08-22"
----

If you are publishing drafts, for example an alpha draft, use the following format:

[source,bash]
----
$ git tag "$VERSION-$BUILD-rel-$DATE-$GUIDE"
----

For example:

[source,bash]
----
$ git tag "6.4-alpha-1-rel-28-jun-2018-getting-started-guide"
----

--
. Push the changes and tags:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git push
$ git push --tags
----
. Check out the stage branch for the same product version and rebase it against the preview branch of the same version, for example:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git checkout 6.4-stage
$ git rebase 6.4-preview
----
. Push the changes in the stage branch:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git push
----
. Navigate to the *Products* page in https://pantheon.cee.redhat.com/#/titles[Pantheon] and open the relevant version of the *{BPMS}* or *{BRMS}* product page (or both, if needed), depending on where the new documents need to be published. Wait for preview and stage build jobs to finish. These were started automatically.
. When the builds complete, click the preview icon image:pantheon-globe-icon.png[] for each document to preview the output.
. In the guide, locate the new line in the revision history you added earlier in this process to ensure the guide was successfully updated.
. Repeat for all the guides you want publish.
+
NOTE: If the guide is not updated, make sure you followed all steps in this procedure. If you are sure you did everything correctly, file a ticket on https://redhat.service-now.com[Helpdesk].
+

. Click the *Publish* button to publish the guide. For multiple guides, select the check box for each guide and click *Bulk actions* -> *Publish* in the upper-right corner of the page.
+
. Wait for up to a few minutes for the guide to be uploaded to the Customer Portal, then navigate to each guide on the portal and verify the updated revision history line.
