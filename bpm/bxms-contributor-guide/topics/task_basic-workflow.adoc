= Overview

The `kie-docs` documentation workflow is based on topic branches as described in the https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/[the GitHub flow]. Using topic branches, you do not commit changes directly to the mainline branch, but instead create a new branch (a topic branch) for every set of related changes (a topic). As an added layer of security, you work in your own fork of the upstream `kie-docs` GitHub repository, and push changes in your GitHub fork first to avoid introducing bugs upstream. After technical and stylistic reviews of the changes are complete, a team gatekeeper can then test and merge the pull requests into the appropriate upstream `kie-docs` branches.

The process for contributing to the `kie-docs` repository consists of the following steps:

. <<fork_upstream_repo,Fork the kie-docs Repository and Add Remotes>>
. <<update_fork,Update Your Fork Branches>>
. <<make_changes,Create Working Branches and Make Changes in Your Fork>>
. <<create_pull_request_fork,Create a Pull Request in Your Fork and Assign SME and Peer Reviews>>
. <<cherry_pick_pull_request,Create a Release Working Branch and Cherry-Pick the Pull Request>>
. <<create_pull_request_upstream,Create Upstream Pull Requests>>
