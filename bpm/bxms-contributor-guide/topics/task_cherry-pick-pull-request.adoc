= Create a release working branch and cherry-pick the fork pull request

[NOTE]
====
Before you begin, please note:

* Skip this section if your document update applies to only a release branch and not to `master`, such as a documented known issue for `7.3.x` that will be resolved in future releases. In that case, you would follow the same steps described in <<make_changes>> to create `7.3.x` working and target branches only (`BXMSDOC-1433-7.3.x` and `BXMSDOC-1433-7.3.x-final`), and no `master` working branch to be cherry-picked.
* If you chose not to <<create_pull_request_fork,create an in-fork pull request>>, then you must <<create_pull_request_upstream,create an upstream pull request>> first and then follow this section to cherry-pick that final (SME and peer approved) pull request onto the release branch.
====

The newly updated `master`-based branch in your fork (`BXMSDOC-1433-master-final`) can now be merged to upstream `master`, but it cannot be merged into the relevant release-specific branch, such as `7.3.x`. To be able to merge the new changes into `7.3.x`, you must first create a second working branch based on `7.3.x` and cherry-pick the changes merged in `BXMSDOC-1433-master-final`.

For the list of active {GROUP_BOTH} repository branches and corresponding community and enterprise release versions, see <<ref_kie-docs-repo-branches>>.

== Prerequisites

* SME and peer have approved your changes, your `master` working branch (`BXMSDOC-1433-master`) has been merged with the target branch (`BXMSDOC-1433-master-final`) in your fork, and your local target branch has been updated and rebased. See <<merge_pull_request_fork>> for details.

If you do not update this local target branch, then when you try to cherry-pick the relevant commit or commits, one of the following errors can appear:
+
[source,bash]
----
fatal: bad object
or
fatal: bad revision
----

[float]
== Procedure

. In your terminal application, change to your `kie-docs` fork and update the `7.3.x` branch:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git fetch --all
$ git checkout 7.3.x # If the branch is not listed locally, use git checkout --track upstream/7.3.x
$ git rebase upstream/7.3.x
$ git push # If pushing for the first time, git push -u origin 7.3.x
----
+
For details, see <<update_fork>>.

. Create a `7.3.x` target branch and push to your fork:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git checkout 7.3.x
$ git checkout -b BXMSDOC-1433-7.3.x-final # New target branch that will cherry-pick BXMSDOC-1433-master-final
$ git push -u origin BXMSDOC-1433-7.3.x-final #First-time push only. Next time use `git push`.
----
+
For details, see <<make_changes>>.

. In a web browser, go to your GitHub account and navigate to your personal fork of the `kie-docs` repository.
. Select the `master` target branch that you previously merged (`BXMSDOC-1433-master-final`) and select *Commits*.
. Find the squashed commit in the commit history that corresponds to your pull request; normally this is the top commit. Copy or note the commit hash (7-digit commit number). You can also click the *Copy the full SHA* clipboard icon to copy the full commit hash.
+
IMPORTANT: If you did not use *Squash and merge* to merge your changes, the changes might be present as several commits, not one commit. For the procedure to cherry-pick them, see <<cherrypick-range>>
+
. In your terminal application, ensure that you are in your newly created `7.3.x` target branch (`BXMSDOC-1433-7.3.x-final`) and run `git cherry-pick $COMMIT_HASH` to cherry-pick the copied pull request:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git checkout BXMSDOC-1433-7.3.x-final
$ git cherry-pick 971aee7
$ git push
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If the `git cherry-pick $COMMIT_HASH` command displays an error message, try `git cherry-pick $COMMIT_HASH -m 1`.
====
+
. Build the cherry-picked target branch (`BXMSDOC-1433-7.3.x-final`) locally to ensure that the changes from `master` were incorporated properly.

The `7.3.x` target branch and the `master` target branch are now ready for upstream merging.

[id="cherrypick-range"]
== Cherry-picking a range of commits

If you did not use *Squash and merge* to merge your changes into the final branch, the changes might be present in the final branch as a range of commits. Also, in some cases, you might want to cherry-pick a range of commits from the working branch instead of the complete set of changes.

Avoid such operations if possible, as there is a greater risk of merge conflicts or other Git issues.

Consider the following example commit history in the working branch in GitHub:

image::github-pull-request-range.png[Range of GitHub commits]

In the final branch, these commits are "squashed" into a single commit. So you can cherry-pick either the whole set of changes, as described in this section, or a range of specified commits (all commits if needed):

* Cherry-pick whole pull request: `git cherry-pick 735add3`
* Cherry-pick range of commits: `git cherry-pick 86557a9^..7bd19d0`

When cherry-picking a range of commits, always use the format $OLDEST_COMMIT^..$LATEST_COMMIT, as shown.

After completing the cherry-picking, push the new branch with `git push`.
