= Contributing to the kie-docs repository

The `kie-docs` documentation workflow is based on topic branches as described in the https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/[the GitHub flow]. Using topic branches, you do not commit changes directly to the mainline branch, but instead create a new branch (a topic branch) for every set of related changes (a topic). As an added layer of security, you work in your own fork of the upstream `kie-docs` GitHub repository, and push changes from a cloned local copy of your fork to your GitHub fork first to avoid introducing bugs upstream. After technical and stylistic reviews of the changes are complete, a team gatekeeper can then test and merge the pull requests into the appropriate upstream `kie-docs` branches.

The following is a high-level view of the content workflow between the upstream `kie-docs` GitHub repo, your GitHub fork of the repo, and your locally cloned copy of your fork:
