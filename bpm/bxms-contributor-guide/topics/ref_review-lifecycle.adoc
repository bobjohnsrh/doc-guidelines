== Review Status Descriptions

Open:: The reviewer is not working on the issue, and no progress is being made.

Coding in Progress:: The reviewer is looking at the draft or has provided feedback. The issue stays in *Coding in Progress* until the writer makes all the necessary changes.

Resolved:: The review has concluded, and the draft is correct from the reviewer's perspective.

Closed (reason):: The review was stopped because the parent JIRA was closed or the review JIRA is otherwise obsolete. Set the reason for closing accordingly (`Won't Do`, `Duplicate`, `Rejected`, or other).
