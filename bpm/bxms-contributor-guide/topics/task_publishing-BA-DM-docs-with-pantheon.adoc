= Publishing BA/DM Guides Using Pantheon

Starting with enterprise version 7.0, the documentation needs to be translated from the `kie-docs` repo in GitHub to the `kie-docs-translator` repo in GitLab using the `bxms-translate` script, and then published in Pantheon.

== Prerequisites

* A Pantheon account with publishing permissions. For more information, see <<_pantheon_roles_and_permissions>>.
* A personal fork of the `kie-docs` repo in https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-docs[GitHub], and a locally cloned copy of `kie-docs` with `upstream` added as a remote. See <<fork_upstream_repo>> for details.
* Access to the `proposal-d` repo in https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/red-hat-jboss-bxms-documentation/proposal-d/tree/master[GitLab], and a locally cloned copy of `proposal-d`. See the `README` file of the repo for details.
* Access to the `kie-docs-translator` repo in https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/red-hat-jboss-bxms-documentation/kie-docs-translator/tree/master[GitLab].

== Procedure

. In your terminal application, navigate to your local copy of the `kie-docs` repo, fetch all updates, and create a working branch based on the upstream branch to be published. In this example, `7.5.x` is the publishing branch for this release.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd ~/kie-docs  #Or the name you have given it
$ git fetch --all  #To retrieve any updates
$ git checkout 7.5.x  #The branch to be published
$ git rebase upstream/7.5.x
$ git push  #To update your fork
$ git checkout -b <JIRA-name>  #Working branch based on 7.5.x
----
+
. Open the `~/kie-docs/docs/shared-kie-docs/src/main/asciidoc/document-attributes.adoc` file in a text editor and update the `:REBUILT:` variable with today's date. Save the file.
. Add and commit the changes with a descriptive commit message, for example:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git commit -m "Update rebuilt variables" docs/shared-kie-docs/src/main/asciidoc/document-attributes.adoc
----
. Tag the commit with a tag that describes which version was published and the current date:
+
--
[source,bash]
----
$ git tag "$VERSION-rel-$DATE"
----

In this example, `$VERSION` is the version of the product, and `$DATE` is the current date in the ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`). For example, the following tag is for version 7.0, which is released on Aug 22 2018:

[source,bash]
----
$ git tag "7.0-rel-2018-08-22"
----

Additionally, if you are publishing drafts, for example an alpha draft, use the following format:

[source,bash]
----
$ git tag "$VERSION-$BUILD-rel-$DATE-guide"
----

For example:

[source,bash]
----
$ git tag "7.0-alpha-1-rel-28-jun-2018-getting-started"
----

--
. Push the changes and tags:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git push
$ git push --tags
----
+
. Create an upstream pull request to merge your working branch with upstream `7.5.x`, and notify a `kie-docs` gatekeeper. For details, see <<create_pull_request_upstream>>.
. After the request is merged, navigate to the `kie-docs` level of the `kie-docs` repo in your terminal application and run the following commands again to fetch your changes and update the applicable branch to be published. In this example, `7.5.x` is the publishing branch for this release.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd ~/kie-docs  #Or the name you have given it
$ git fetch --all  #Should list your update
$ git checkout 7.5.x  #The branch to be published
$ git rebase upstream/7.5.x
$ git push  #Not necessary for translation, but best
----
+
. Now that your local copy of `kie-docs` and the publishing branch are updated, run the `bxms-translate` command from the same location (in top-level `kie-docs` directory):
+
[source,bash]
----
$ bxms-translate
----
+
The translate script can take several minutes to run, or much longer depending on Internet connection.
+
If you see any permission errors for `bxms-docs` or `kie-docs-translator` in GitLab, contact a <<_contact_information,brms-docs team>> member for help.
+
. After the script completes, navigate to the *Products* page in https://pantheon.cee.redhat.com/#/titles[Pantheon] and open the *{ba}* or *{dm}* product page (or both, if needed), depending on where the new documents need to be published. Wait for preview and stage build jobs to finish. These were started automatically.
. When the builds complete, click the preview icon image:pantheon-globe-icon.png[] for each document to preview the output.
. In the guide, locate the new line in the revision history you added earlier in this process to ensure the guide was successfully updated.
. Repeat for all the guides you want publish.
+
NOTE: If the guide is not updated, make sure you followed all steps in this procedure. If you are sure you did everything correctly, file a ticket on https://redhat.service-now.com[Helpdesk].
+

. Click the *Publish* button to publish the guide. For multiple guides, select the check box for each guide and click *Bulk actions* -> *Publish* in the upper-right corner of the page.
+
. Wait for up to a few minutes for the guide to be uploaded to the Customer Portal, then navigate to each guide on the portal and verify the updated revision history line..
