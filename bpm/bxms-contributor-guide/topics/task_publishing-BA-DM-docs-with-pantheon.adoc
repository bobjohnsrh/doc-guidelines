= Publishing {GROUP_BA} documents using Pantheon

Starting with enterprise version 7.0, the documentation needs to be translated from the `kie-docs` repo in GitHub to the `kie-docs-translator` repo in GitLab using the `ba-translate` script, and then published in Pantheon.

== Prerequisites

* A Pantheon account with publishing permissions. For more information, see <<_pantheon_roles_and_permissions>>.
* A personal fork of the `kie-docs` repo in https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-docs[GitHub], and a locally cloned copy of `kie-docs` with `upstream` added as a remote. See <<fork_upstream_repo>> for details.
* Access to the `proposal-d` repo in https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/red-hat-jboss-bxms-documentation/proposal-d/tree/master[GitLab], and a locally cloned copy of `proposal-d`. See the `README` file of the repo for details.
* Access to the `kie-docs-translator` repo in https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/red-hat-jboss-bxms-documentation/kie-docs-translator/tree/master[GitLab].

== Procedure

. In your terminal application, navigate to your local copy of the `kie-docs` repo, fetch all updates, and create a working branch based on `master`:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd ~/kie-docs  #Or the name you have given it
$ git fetch --all  #To retrieve any updates
$ git checkout master
$ git rebase upstream/master
$ git push  #To update your fork
$ git checkout -b BXMSDOC-1234-master  #Working branch based on master, using publish JIRA ID
----
+
. Open the `~/kie-docs/docs/shared-kie-docs/src/main/asciidoc/document-attributes.adoc` file in a text editor and update the `:REBUILT:` variable with today's date. Save the file.
. Add and commit the changes with a descriptive commit message, and push to your fork:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "BXMSDOC-1234-master Update rebuilt variable"
$ git push --set-upstream $YOUR_FORK_NAME BXMSDOC-1234-master  #First-time push
----
+
. Switch to the upstream branch to be published, in this example `7.5.x`, and likewise rebase it against upstream `7.5.x` and create a similar working branch (`BXMSDOC-1234-7.5.x`). Then cherry-pick the commit you made in the `master` working branch (`BXMSDOC-1234-master`) for updating the `:REBUILT:` variable.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd ~/kie-docs
$ git checkout 7.5.x  #The branch to be published
$ git rebase upstream/7.5.x
$ git push  #To update your fork
$ git checkout -b BXMSDOC-1234-7.5.x  #Working branch based on 7.5.x, using publish JIRA ID
$ git cherry-pick 971aee7  #Commit hash for the :REBUILT: variable update in master
----
+
. Tag the commit with a tag that describes which version was published and the current date:
+
--
[source,bash]
----
$ git tag "$PRODUCT-$VERSION-rel-$DATE"
----

The `_$PRODUCT_` is `DM` or `BA`, the `_$VERSION_` is the version of the product, and the `_$DATE_` is the current date in the ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`). For example, the following tag is for {DM} version 7.1, released on April 30, 2018:

[source,bash]
----
$ git tag "DM-7.1-rel-2018-04-30"
----

If this is a combination release of both DM and BA, then add two tags:

[source,bash]
----
$ git tag "DM-7.1-rel-2018-04-30"
$ git tag "BA-7.0-rel-2018-04-30"
----

If you are publishing a draft, for example an alpha draft, use the following format:

[source,bash]
----
$ git tag "$PRODUCT-$VERSION-$BUILD-rel-$DATE-$GUIDE"
----

For example:

[source,bash]
----
$ git tag "DM-7.2-alpha-1-rel-2018-07-30-getting-started"
----

--
. Push the cherry-picked branch and the new tags:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git push --set-upstream $YOUR_FORK_NAME BXMSDOC-1234-7.5.x  #First-time push
$ git push --tags
----
. Create an upstream pull request to merge the two new working branches (`BXMSDOC-1234-master` and `BXMSDOC-1234-7.5.x`) with upstream `master` and `7.5.x`, respectively, and notify a `kie-docs` gatekeeper. For details, see <<create_pull_request_upstream>>.
. After the request is merged, navigate to the `kie-docs` level of the `kie-docs` repo in your terminal application and run the following commands again to fetch your changes and update the applicable branch to be published. In this example, `7.5.x` is the publishing branch for this release.
+
--
[source,bash]
----
$ cd ~/kie-docs  #Or the name you have given it
$ git fetch --all  #Should list your update
$ git checkout 7.5.x  #The branch to be published
$ git rebase upstream/7.5.x
$ git push  #Not necessary for translation, but best
----
--
. Now that the rebuilt date is changed and merged, run the `ba-translate $RELEASE_BRANCH` command in your computer (the location is not important):
+
--
[source,bash]
----
$ ba-translate 7.11.x
----

NOTE: For release branches 7.7.x and earlier, run `bxms-translate-branch $RELEASE_BRANCH` instead.

The translate script can take up to 15 minutes to run, or much longer with a slow Internet connection.

If you see any permission errors for `bxms-docs` or `kie-docs-translator` in GitLab, contact a <<_contact_information,brms-docs team>> member for help.
--
. After the script completes, navigate to the *Products* page in https://pantheon.cee.redhat.com/#/titles[Pantheon] and open the *{PAM}* or *{DM}* product page (or both, if needed), depending on where the new documents need to be published. Wait for preview and stage build jobs to finish. These were started automatically.
. When the builds complete, click the preview icon image:pantheon-globe-icon.png[] for each document to preview the output.
. In the guide, locate the new line in the revision history you added earlier in this process to ensure the guide was successfully updated.
. Repeat for all the guides you want publish.
+
NOTE: If the guide is not updated, make sure you followed all steps in this procedure. If you are sure you did everything correctly, file a ticket on https://redhat.service-now.com[Helpdesk].
+

. Click the *Publish* button to publish the guide. For multiple guides, select the check box for each guide and click *Bulk actions* -> *Publish* in the upper-right corner of the page.
+
. Wait for up to a few minutes for the guide to be uploaded to the Customer Portal, then navigate to each guide on the portal and verify the updated revision history line..
