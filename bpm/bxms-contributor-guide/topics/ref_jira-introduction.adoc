The issues with the product documentation are hosted on JBoss https://issues.jboss.org[JIRA], an issue tracking system used by multiple Red Hat JBoss Middleware products. Software-related issues are hosted on JIRA as well. For detailed instructions on how to create a product documentation (BXMS) task in JIRA, see the https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1081009[BxMS documentation] Mojo page.

The product uses several JIRA projects to track the issues:
