= JIRA issue tracking

The issues with the product documentation are hosted on JBoss https://issues.jboss.org[JIRA], an issue tracking system used by multiple Red Hat JBoss Middleware products. Software-related issues are hosted on JIRA as well. For detailed instructions on how to create a product documentation (`BXMSDOC`) task in JIRA, see the https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1081009[BxMS documentation] Mojo page.

NOTE: `BXMS` is a deprecated abbreviation for {GROUP_BA} software products, still used in some internal Red Hat projects and tools, such as JIRA.

The product uses several JIRA projects to track the issues:
