= Create Upstream Pull Requests

After all reviews are complete and your `master` and release target branches in your fork (`BXMSDOC-1433-master-final` and `BXMSDOC-1433-7.3.x-final`) are ready to be merged upstream, you create an upstream pull request for each branch: one for upstream `master` and one for upstream `7.3.x`.


[float]
== Prerequisites

* Your `master` working branch (`BXMSDOC-1433-master`) has been approved by the SME and peer reviewers and merged with the preliminary target branch in your fork (`BXMSDOC-1433-master-final`). See <<create_pull_request_fork>> for details.
* You have created a target branch based on the relevant release (`BXMSDOC-1433-7.3.x-final`) and have cherry-picked the changes from the `master` target branch (`BXMSDOC-1433-master-final`) onto it in your fork. See <<cherry_pick_pull_request>> for details.

[float]
== Procedure

. In a web browser, go to your GitHub account and navigate to your personal fork of the `kie-docs` repository.
. Create two separate pull requests, one for each target branch in your fork to be merged upstream.

For the upstream `master` pull request:

* `*base fork:*` The central `kie-docs` repository (`kie-group/kie-docs`)
* `*base:*` The upstream `master` branch
* `*head fork:*` Your own fork (`$USER/kie-docs`)
* `*compare:*` The target branch for `master` containing the changes to be merged upstream (`BXMSDOC-1433-master-final`)

For the upstream `7.3.x` pull request:

* `*base fork:*` The central `kie-docs` repository (`kie-group/kie-docs`)
* `*base:*` The upstream `7.3.x` branch
* `*head fork:*` Your own fork (`$USER/kie-docs`)
* `*compare:*` The target branch for `7.3.x` containing the cherry-picked changes to be merged upstream (`BXMSDOC-1433-7.3.x-final`)

ifdef::INTERNAL[]
. In the pull request, add a link to the documentation JIRA and a link to the rendered output from your link:https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-14590[shared public directory].
endif::INTERNAL[]
ifdef::PUBLIC[]
. In the pull request, add links to any needed documentation resources, such as a related JIRA or a shared public directory with the rendered document preview.
endif::Public[]

. Notify the gatekeeper that the pull request is ready to be reviewed and merged.

Once all of the above steps are complete, the gatekeeper will confirm that the required reviews are present and that the checks passed for the automated build.

If any merge conflicts or other build problems arise, the gatekeeper will contact you to resolve them.

After all issues are resolved, the gatekeeper will merge the pull request.
