= GitHub pull request reviews

GitHub is not used for tracking issues or development progress of the documentation, only for managing pull requests. To report an issue, use <<jira-introduction, JIRA>>.

ifdef::INTERNAL[]
Pull requests concerning the enterprise documentation set are internally tracked in JIRA.
endif::INTERNAL[]

Each pull request is subject to the same review from the Engineering team, and from the CCS Gatekeeper or a writer.

NOTE: A writer can be appointed to perform tasks marked "Gatekeeper," especially in situations when too many contributions must be reviewed in a short time frame.
