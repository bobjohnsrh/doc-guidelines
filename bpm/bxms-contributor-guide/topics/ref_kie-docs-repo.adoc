= {GROUP_BOTH} documentation repository

The `kie-docs` repository in https://www.github.com/droolsjbpm/kie-docs[GitHub] contains both the community and enterprise sources for {GROUP_BOTH} documentation. This repository is publicly accessible, but only members of the {GROUP_BA} development and documentation teams can commit to it.

Previously, the enterprise documentation sources were hosted in an internal https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com[GitLab] instance. This repository is no longer used for development and does not accept any further code changes.

NOTE: To contribute to the repository, follow the instructions in <<_contributing>>.
