We use special `make` targets to fetch and update in-tree copies of upstream content. After using these targets, be sure to commit the changes.

The syntax used is `make refresh-upstream-_UPSTREAM_NAME_`

For example:

[source]
----
$ make refresh-upstream-qpid-dispatch
$ make refresh-upstream-qpid-jms
$ make refresh-upstream-qpid-proton
----
