= Combining user stories and modular docs

A user story is documented by populating an assembly file with predefined files (a concept file, a procedure file, and a reference file) from a Modular Docs framework.
It is important to note that none of the module types are obligatory.
The following illustrates the make-up of a generic user story structure from an *.adoc* point of view:

[source,bash]
----
assembly.adoc
    |________ concept-module.adoc
    |________ procedure-module.adoc
    |________ procedure-module.adoc
    |________ reference-module.adoc
----
