= Combining user stories and modular docs

A user story is documented by populating an assembly file with predefined files (a concept file, a procedure file, and a reference file) from the Modular Docs framework. Itâ€™s important to note that none of the module types is obligatory. The following illustrates a generic user-story structure in docs source code:

assembly.adoc
    |________ concept-module.adoc
    |________ procedure-module.adoc
    |________ procedure-module.adoc
    |________ reference-module.adoc
